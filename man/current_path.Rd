current_path()

\description{
Return the URL path of the current HTTP request,
as captured in the freshwater request context. If
called outside of an active context, an empty string
is returned.

This is primarily intended for use inside templates
where the request context has been established.

Context is Available when freshwater context middleware is
active (installed automatically by api_csrf(),
api_error_pages(), or api_freshwater()).
